## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who mostly speaks Java and JavaScript (and sometimes to myself when debugging).

I like to think of myself as a **builder** and **problem solver** â€” someone who enjoys tinkering with new technologies, experimenting with fresh ideas, and using code to make things better (or at least break them more creatively).

Right now, I'm based in **Auckland**, enjoying the peace and scenery. I'm currently **open to job opportunities**, whether you're in Auckland or anywhere that remote work can reach. Feel free to reach out!

I'm currently working on a project called **[Sparrow](https://github.com/aizhimou/sparrow)** â€” it's practical, it's useful, and hey, you should totally check it out.

If you're curious about me, feel free to drop by my **[homepage](https://asimov.top)** â€” there's more stuff there that might interest you.
