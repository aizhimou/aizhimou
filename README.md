## Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer who mostly speaks Java and JavaScript (and sometimes to myself when debugging).

I like to think of myself as a **builder👷‍♂️** and **problem solver👨‍🔧** — someone who enjoys tinkering with new technologies, experimenting with fresh ideas, and using code to make things better (or at least break them more creatively).

By day, I've spent years working in the enterprise software world. By night (and weekends), I open-source personal projects that might be helpful to others — or at least mildly interesting 😉.

Right now, I'm based in **Auckland**, enjoying the peace 🕊️, the scenery 🏞️, and the seagull ̼. I'm currently **open to job opportunities**, whether you're in Auckland or anywhere that remote work can reach. Feel free to reach out!

I'm currently working on a project called **[Sparrow](https://github.com/aizhimou/sparrow)** — it's practical, it's useful, and hey, you should totally check it out.

And if you're curious about any of my projects — or just want to chat tech — my inbox is always open 💬 (I promise I don’t bite.
